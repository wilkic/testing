testing
=======

a test repo where I put documentation as an example of either:

1. how github can be used
2. testing functionallity for other projects
3. playing around with markdown
4. understanding subtreees
5. trying out all sorts of git commands
6. learning all the goods on branching
 * and how to maintain them
