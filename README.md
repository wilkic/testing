testing
=======

a test repo where I put documentation as an example of either:

1. how github can be used
 1. how remotes work diff from local branches
1. testing functionallity for other projects
1. playing around with markdown
1. understanding subtreees
1. trying out all sorts of git commands
1. learning all the goods on branching
 * and how to maintain them

something production specific
